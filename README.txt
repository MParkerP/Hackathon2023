# Math Educational Game - Earth Day Hackathon
Welcome to our Math Educational Game, developed during the Earth Day Hackathon! Our team of developers, designers, and educators came together to create an engaging and interactive game that teaches math concepts while also highlighting the importance of taking care of our planet.

## The Game
Our game is set in a fictional world where players must complete various math challenges to help clean up the environment. The challenges range in difficulty and cover various math topics such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Players earn points for each challenge they complete successfully, and these points can be used to unlock special power-ups to help them complete future challenges.

As players progress through the game, they will learn about the impact that humans have on the environment and the steps they can take to reduce their carbon footprint. Our game is designed to be both fun and educational, and we believe that it will be an excellent tool for teachers and parents to use in the classroom or at home.

## Getting Started
To get started with our game, simply download the game file from our GitHub repository and run it on your computer. The game is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, and requires no additional software to run.

## How to Play
Once you have the game running, you will be prompted to create a new player profile. This profile will track your progress through the game and store your high scores.

After creating your profile, you will be taken to the game's main menu. From here, you can select a level to play or access the game's settings menu.

Each level consists of a series of math challenges that you must complete to progress to the next level. You will have a limited amount of time to complete each challenge, so be sure to work quickly and accurately.

If you get stuck on a particular challenge, you can use one of your power-ups to help you out. Power-ups include things like extra time, hints, and even the ability to skip a challenge altogether.

## Contributing
Our game was developed during the Earth Day Hackathon, and we welcome contributions from anyone who is interested in improving the game or adding new features. To contribute, simply fork our GitHub repository and submit a pull request with your changes.

## Conclusion
We are proud of the Math Educational Game we developed during the Earth Day Hackathon, and we believe that it will be a valuable resource for educators and parents who are looking for a fun and engaging way to teach math and environmental awareness. We hope that you enjoy playing our game and that you learn something new while doing so!
